- choosed - HNSW
- I can use Flat search which is the full NN search now. I am gonna have only. 100s of files only. At max I'll get <10k vectores. But keeping the future in the mind. I might need to search my whole laptop sometimes. I might get more number of documents.
- So going for HNSW felt right because I can trade little bit of accuracy for speed.
