    "\n",
    "Instruction-tuned models are language models that have been **trained to follow instructions** instead of just completing text.\n",

    "## Base Model vs Instruction-Tuned Model\n",
    "\n",
    "### Base Model (e.g., Llama 3.1 Base)\n",
    "- **Trained on**: Books, websites, code (just predicting next word)\n",
    "- **Good at**: Completing sentences, generating text that flows naturally\n",
    "- **Problem**: Doesn't understand you're asking a question\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: \"What is the capital of France?\"\n",
    "Output: \"is a common question asked in geography classes...\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "❌ It just continues the text, doesn't answer!\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instruction-Tuned Model (e.g., Llama 3.1 Instruct)\n",
    "- **Extra training on**: Question-answer pairs, instructions with responses\n",
    "- **Good at**: Following instructions, answering questions, staying on topic\n",
    "- **Understands**: When you ask a question, you want an answer\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "```\n",
    "Input: \"What is the capital of France?\"\n",
    "Output: \"The capital of France is Paris.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "✅ It understands and answers directly!\n",

    "## How Instruction Tuning Works\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Step 1: Pre-training (Base Model)\n",
    "├── Read millions of web pages, books, code\n",
    "├── Learn language patterns and facts\n",
    "└── Result: Can generate text, but doesn't follow instructions\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Instruction Fine-Tuning\n",
    "├── Train on thousands of (instruction → response) pairs\n",
    "│   Example pairs:\n",
    "│   • \"Explain Python\" → \"Python is a programming language...\"\n",
    "│   • \"Summarize this code\" → [concise summary]\n",
    "│   • \"Answer based on context\" → [uses only provided info]\n",
    "└── Result: Follows instructions like a helpful assistant\n",
    "```\n",
